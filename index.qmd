title: "GG606 Scientific Data Wrangling"

# Introduction

*Scheduled as Tuesdays 09:00--11:20, DAWB 3-105 (Dr Alvin Woods Building)*

## Course Description

This course covers the data science skills comprising data visualization, data wrangling (cleaning, combining, modelling, etc.), and methodological and statistical design, which are an important part of the scientific method.

## Learning Objectives

-   describe the characteristics of datasets in order to plan for data wrangling and visualisation

-   develop workflows for dealing with disparate data types

-   apply knowledge to tidy, transform, visualise, model datasets similar to thesis/project data

-   develop a template for a reproducible workflow including metadata

## Goals of the Course

Skills and products developed in this course will be employed on models built on example data sets generated for each research chapter of each student's thesis/project, i.e. data sets that are messy, contain holes, and have different statistical distributions. Students will benefit from working with data flows they have developed and modified based on collaborative interactions with classmates via multi-user repositories.

### Assignments

Two assignments will require students to demonstrate data wrangling and visualisation skills learned in the course. Data sets will be provided.

### Term Project

Students will demonstrate a technical topic with a complete analytic walk-through of an existing analysis from a paper in an area of interest or through a demonstration of a specialized statistical or analysis method through the use of `R` packages.

### Participation

Students will be expected to attend and participate in designated course times. Participate includes contributing to discussions and working collaboratively with other students when needed.
